  "weaknesses": [
    {
      "area": "e.g., scalability/system-design/algorithms/communication",
      "explanation": "short phrase about what was missing",
      "severity": "low|medium|high"
    }
  ],
  "exercises": [
    {
      "title": "One-line exercise",
      "description": "1-2 sentence task that can be completed and measured",
      "time_estimate_min": 30
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {"title": "Resource name", "url": ""}
  ]
}

Input (session summary):
{{SESSION_SUMMARY}}

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Keep the whole JSON short (<= 300 words).
- For exercises prefer concrete tasks (e.g., \"Design DB schema for URL shortener and write schema\"), not generic advice.
